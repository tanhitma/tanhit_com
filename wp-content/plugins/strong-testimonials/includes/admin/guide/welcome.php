	<p>The &#91;strong&#93;, &#91;wpmtst&#93; and &#91;read_more&#93; shortcodes and the original widget <span
			style="color: red;">were removed</span> in version 2.0. Everything
		now happens in <b>Views</b>.</p>

	<p>Why?</p>
	<ol>
		<li>It was not simple to learn (I built an entire demo site just for it).</li>
		<li>It was not simple to maintain or add new features (it has a lot of moving parts).</li>
		<li>It was not simple to support (especially for non-native English speakers).</li>
		<li>The kicker was a new irreconcilable conflict with a major plugin.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>And for a “short” code, it’s not very short. ;) In many ways, it was limited right out of the gate but it got the job done.</p>

	<p><em>This is the last major change, I promise.</em> <a href="https://www.wpmission.com/strong-testimonials-version-2-coming-soon/" target="_blank">Read more here</a>.</p>

	<h4 class="large"><?php _e( 'What\'s new' ); ?></h4>

	<p>Comments are now available for individual testimonials. <a
			href="https://www.wpmission.com/tutorials/how-to-add-comments-in-strong-testimonials/" target="_blank">Full
			tutorial</a>.</p>

	<p>Improved date format handling.</p>

	<p>Improved compatibility with <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/posts-for-page/" target=_"blank">Posts for
			Page</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-content-shortcode/" target="_blank">Custom Content
			Shortcode</a>, and other plugins that use shortcodes to pull in other content.</p>

	<p>Minor bugs and theme conflicts fixed.</p>

	<p>Improvements in compatibility, speed, and troubleshooting.</p>
